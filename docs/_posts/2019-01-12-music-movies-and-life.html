            Music, Movies and well Writing have always been an integral part to me, firstly having been introduced to music 
            when i started learning the guitar in 8th grade, then writing during my 10th grade when after reading the entire "Percy Jackson" series, 
            I felt heavily inspired to write and movies, which was my favourite pass time after coming from college during my 11th and 12th grade

            Although over the years through college, I have had less time to enjoy them fully (for which I blame myself), I am 
            however going to make it a point to do spend a certain amount of time on the following three. Writing - by writing regulalrly through
            my blog, reading by giving regular updates about books I am reading or have read and music probably by just doing it
