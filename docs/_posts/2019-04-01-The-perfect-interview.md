Let's get real - Interviews are frustrating for a number of reasons: we get nervous because of the need to speak, the process is super tiring and may more, but perhaps the most frustrating thing about an interview (for me at least) is that there is a human being on the judging counter and that some how when it comes to human beings, there is always a doubt of whether things have been done in right way or not. But they do really make a difference?


Some things just are psychological to be taken care of, like the fact that coming in first or last in line for an interviews is more likely (through out this post I will be talking in terms of likelihood and probability and not assurance) to be remembered better by the interviewer, others such as the stories of interviewers fighting with their better half and hence showing their feelings on the interviewee or the interviewer having certain stereotypes such as people who can't speak English well are not well qualified (in jobs where being fluent in English is not a necessity) or the fact that a particular interviewer asks the most absurd pf questions and then comes to a conclusion that you aren't fit for the job, do get on our nerves and can be quite frustrating if encountered with. But they do really make a difference? Would it be justified to blame an interviewer for your loss? Probably a play with a few numbers can give a 10,000 feet few of the situation. (NOTE - the below study is just a play with random numbers, not at all accurate)



Assume you rarely meet such people however they have a huge influence.



- probability that the an interviewer who is in a bad mood contributes towards not registering you as a worthy candidate - 0.5

-  probability that the an interviewer who has a bias contributes towards not registering you as a worthy candidate - 0.5

- probability that you contribute towards a negative bias which the interviewer has - 0.1

- probability that you meet an interviewer who is in mood (a)  only - 0.1

- probability that you meet an interviewer who has a bias (b) only - 0.1

- probability that you meet someone with both - 0.05

- probability that you will clear the interviewer without external factors - 0.7



probability of clearing  (1 - (0.1 x 0.5 + 0.1 x 0.5 x 0.1 + 0.05 x 0.5 x 0.1 + 0.05 x 0.5) ) ~ 9% reduction



Assuming you meet such people more often but have less influence



- probability that the an interviewer who is in a bad mood contributes towards not registering you as a worthy candidate - 0.1

-  probability that the an interviewer who has a bias contributes towards not registering you as a worthy candidate - 0.1

- probability that you contribute towards a negative bias which the interviewer has - 0.1

- probability that you meet an interviewer who is in mood (a)  only - 0.3

- probability that you meet an interviewer who has a bias (b) only - 0.3

- probability that you meet someone with both - 0.2




probability that you will clear it  (1 - (0.3 x 0.1 + 0.3 x 0.1 x 0.1 + 0.2 x 0.1  + 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1) ) ~ 6% reduction



Assuming absolute bad luck where interviewers with a bad mood are high in number and influential



probability that you will clear it  (1 - (0.3 x 0.5 + 0.3 x 0.5 x 0.1 + 0.2 x 0.5  + 0.2 x 0.5 x 0.1) ) ~ 28% reduction



perhaps according to the following if you were to unluckily to have a bias which an interviewer carries then your chances would drop another ~ 4-7%



A descent average for the following could be about ~ 12%. So would a 12% according to our over the top study seem like a good number to feel worried about? Well I guess that has to do with the situation itself. A person with about 58% would still have more than 50% chances of clearing the interview. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of marks, the ones most affected would be ones just above average, however if you were to consider a low acceptance rate of interviews, you were probably not going to be selected in the first place.

So to answer our question - does the interviewer play a big role in you not clearing your interview? Yes only if you were among the highly intelligent, you got the worst of the interviewers and you couldn't impress them with your intelligence while your other highly intelligent competitors got away with good interviewers, otherwise nope, not really. How likely is this to happen? probably never cause if your intelligence doesn't impress, then you probably do have a history with the interviewer.
