Hey there ! I am Jayakrishna Sahit, a third computer science major at the Indian Institite of Technology, Gandhinagar. This blog is a personal collection of artciles which I have written, reviews on some good reads and movies, some interesting things which I find in the world of computer science and psychology.

Feel free to ping me on my social media accounts or dropping a mail to me about anything which you like, dislike or simply wish to talk about with me.
